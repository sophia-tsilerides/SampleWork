# Sample Work 2019
Hi! 

My name is Sophia. 

I'm an MS in Data Science candidate at NYU's Center for Data Science. And if you haven't already gotten it from that opening sentence, I love Data Science!

Our world is experiencing an influx of data with the immense potential of making our cities, economies, and lives smarter and more efficient. Exciting opportunities await beyond this rapidly evolving world of data science and I am so excited to be a part of it. 

I aspire to be part of the changes that are happening in business today; to operate an organization directly and efficiently using insights from data with new technology. This repository contains some of my sample work and research from academia. 

Outside of the lab I am part of an organization that advocates for women in the workplace. Through my professional experiences, I have noticed there are few women in finance and tech. As a female with a passion in these industries, I realize it is time to promote diversity and be celebrated in these sectors.

Crowdsourcing repos like these give everyone an equal opportunity to learn about what interests them the most and I am looking forward to being a part of that.
