    "In the above equation $\\text{count}(e_i, c)$ is the number of documents in a given class that contain feature $e_i$ and $\\text{count}(c)$ is the number of documents that belong to class $c$. \n",

    "The problem with Naivee Bayes is that if a particular attribute value does not occur in the training data set, the results may be misleading. A common variation of the above is to use Laplace (sometimes called +1) smoothing. \n",

    "We add a Laplace Estimator to the attributes when calculating probabilities so that any value that occurs zero times will be replaced by a non-zero number. This prevents the possibility of getting 0 or 1 for a probability. To do this, we add a value to the numerator and the denominator for every category. In terms of the bias-variance tradeoff, if the Laplace Estimator is 0 (so we don't have a Laplace estimator) our model is overfitting and there is high variance because for a very small change in the training data there is very different model. If a large value is used as a Laplace Estimator, the influence of observed counts will be lower because estimated probabilities for the same number of observations will be lower. Thus, variance in the model is lower but there is larger bias. \n",
    "\n",
    "A case when using a Laplace estimator can lead to better results is in spam filtering with two classes: \"Ham\" or \"Spam.\" Let's also assume the probability of spam or ham is 50/50. If we get an email that our classifier rates as P(Ham|words in email) = .90 and P(Spam|words in email) = .10 we can say that the email is probably not spam. However, if we get another email that's almost identical to the first but with 1 extra word, the word's count is 0. Thus, we'd get P(Ham|words in email + 1 extra word) = P(Spam|words in email + 1 extra word) = 0. Therefore, despite the first email being strongly classified as Ham, the second email with just a one word difference has a probability of being Ham equal to zero without a Laplace Estimator to smooth out the probabilities.\n"

The war depicted in this production is not found on a battlefield, but on training grounds of a Louisiana-based instruction camp between conceptions and fears of the soldiers in training.

    "The Logistic Regression with Tfidf vectorizer consistently performs the best. It has the highest AUC and in a 10-fold cross validation and it has the highest mean accuracy and lowest standard deviation accuracy which means it's performance is high without an extreme varying degree. This may be because Tfidf emphasizes rare words in addition to the count of the words. Accuracy may be misleading because it makes no distinction between false positive and false negative errors, however it is a simple and straight forward measure that I believe is appropriate here.  \n",

    "The Bernoulli Count vectorizer and the Tfidf vectorizer perform identically. They have the same spread and AUC. This may be because BernoulliNB assumes each data feature to be a binary-valued variable. It also explicitly penalizes the non-occurrence of a feature that is an indicator for class.\n",

The above mentioned factors are probably the reasons it is low rated but just ignore that and give it a whirl if youre a fan of the genre.

I think one of the best things about the concept where its not just the house thats haunted its whoever goes into the house. They become haunted no matter where they are. Office buildings police stations hotel rooms... etc. After reading some of the external reviews I am really surprised that critics didnt like this film. I am going to see it again this week and am excited about it. I gave this film 10 stars because it did what a horror film should. It scared the s**t out of me.'\""

       "\"'This movies origins are a mystery to me as I only know as much as IMDB did before I rented it. I assume that before Starship Troopers Killshot was one of the countless unaired pilots that never made it to network cable or otherwise. The new title of Kill Shot is comically thrown into the opening sequence the first of many quick clues that this was not ever intended for the cinema. The quick cuts cheesy Melrose Place music and short 2-second close-up candid shots of the main actors let you know what youre in for. And I dont mind at all. I rented this movie seeing the repackaging that puts Casper Van Dien and Denise Richards on the cover in front of a volleyball net thinking it would be funny to see them in a movie besides the SciFi travesty of Starship Troopers (an excellent book in my opinion not so hot a movie - but thats another review). After looking it up on IMDB my roommate and I surmised that the pilot was dragged up after the apparent success of Troopers and Richards own career (see Bond-Girl and Wild Things references here). They threw in a sex scene involving a minor character to reach the coveted R-rated status - coveted in suspense Video Rental sections that is. In any event they should have left it unrated if youre trying to sell it in the suspense/softcore porn section. All in all its entertaining. I hate to spoil the fun of telling you its a TV pilot though. That was the biggest pull while watching it - when you expect a cinematic movie and get a TV show the differences between them make themselves more clear than usual. Would I rent it again? No. Would I watch this TV show? Well why not - its better than Baywatch. And their meager attempts at hitting all demographics would have done well back in the mid 90s. Token black guy (whos gay to avoid the TV taboo of inter-racial dating) token Asian (Japanese I assume from the name Koji) more adept at science and computers than talking to women beautiful intelligent Latina pre-med student who has everything going for her except her familys bank account - this show probably would have done ok. But as a movie it just cracks me. I gave it a 7 out of 10 considering what it was and what it was forced to become. It made for a very enjoyable evening and thats all I ask of rentals.'\""

This film sure does deliver the jumps and thrills! To be fair I did watch it at almost midnight so I was kinda sleepy anyway so maybe that explains why I was jumpy...or maybe its because this film does deliver in that aspect! Its basically about a couple who lose their child in a tragic event. They decide to move away and rent a cabin looking thing in the mountains...all looks peaceful and calm until they have their first visitors (i think its its the sister of the main character and she brings along her husband)...during the night the husband hears noises...checks it out and thats when things start to go really really wrong...they dont stay for another day and tell the couple they should leave asap as something isnt right...to cut a long story short...eventually they find out what has happened in that house in the past few years and decide it needs to be taken care of. Its not a Hollywood blockbuster nore does it have a huge budget but please dont let that put you off. Its creepy tense and very very jumpy! Just give it a try :)'\""
